# Welcome to my Raspberry Pi App!!

This repository serves as an umbrella repo to all the related repo's for my pi app. This app uses a pi and an LED display to run different screens on the display. It features a front-end controller that lets the user switch the displays, display album covers, or leave custom text on the screen. It also features several backend services for the displays such as an API that handles the request from the controller and even a weather micro-service all connected through message busses with RabbitMQ!
